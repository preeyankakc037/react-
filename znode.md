# Day 4 : LearnUseState 
In React, useState is a Hook that allows functional components to have state. It lets you declare a state variable and a function to update it. When the state changes using this function, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the new value. This makes it easy to manage dynamic data, like form inputs, counters, or toggles, directly within functional components.
